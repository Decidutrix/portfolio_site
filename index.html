    <!--description pt2-->
    <p1>Hi I'm Snug and I'm a computer programmer. I started programming in the 10th grade, I know Python, Java, C++, C#, and NodeJS. I like to play video games such as League of Legends, Dark Souls and Nintendo games like Zelda and Mario.<br> A lot of these games taught me how 
        to overcome difficult situations, have better teamwork and cooperation. I'm currently in my first quarter of programming but second quarter of college. I stream whatever I'm programming 
    </p1>
